# Akai s612 ❤️ Modular

What happens when you sample a modular synth with an Akai S612 and then record the results into a PC? Something like this..
This collection pairs an Akai S612 with a Eurorack modular, A Elektron Machinedrum and a Jomox 999 . Hundreds of one shots, drums and patches.

**This collection requires you to download the audio seperately**
